Nearnia
====================
Nearnia is a SAAS company providing services to the restaurant industry and it's patrons. To the small restaurant, we offer a platform that funnels foot-traffic to their place of business during slow periods only. To the patron, we offer exclusive time-sensitive deals in driving distance. We are a win-win solution for a slowing industry. Most importantly, support your community! Bon appetit! 

This site is based on the open source version of a mobile-ready template using Fusion Tables and jQuery Mobile, originally based on Derek Eder's [Fusion Table Searchable Map Template](https://github.com/derekeder/FusionTable-Map-Template).

This is an SF Brigade project for Code for America. Started by Mark Brenig-Jones, completed by Rego Sen, with contributions from Sidney Zhang and Andrew Byrne.

I want to thank them all.
